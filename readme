# RESTful API using Node.js and Express

This repository contains a **RESTful API** built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** as part of **Module 2 Assignment: Build a RESTful API using Node.js**. The project demonstrates core backend concepts such as routing, middleware, HTTP methods, status codes, validation, and error handling using an in-memory data source.

run the command npm i first

## 🎯 Assignment Objective

To create a simple RESTful API for managing a list of users while testing the following concepts:

* Express routing
* HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Middleware usage
* Request validation
* Error handling with proper status codes
* In-memory data storage

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Postman / Thunder Client (for API testing)

---

## 📁 Project Setup

### 1. Initialize Node.js Project

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

Server runs on the configured port (e.g., `http://localhost:8086`).

## 📌 API Routes

### User Object Structure

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "firstName": "Anshika",
  "lastName": "Agarwal",
  "hobby": "Teaching"
}
```

### Available Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint   | Description             |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | /users     | Fetch all users         |
| GET    | /users/:id | Fetch user by ID        |
| POST   | /user      | Add a new user          |
| PUT    | /user/:id  | Update an existing user |
| DELETE | /user/:id  | Delete a user by ID     |

## 🧩 Middleware Implementation

### 1. Logging Middleware

* Logs request method, URL, and response status code for every request.

### 2. Validation Middleware

* Validates required fields (`firstName`, `lastName`, `hobby`) for **POST** and **PUT** requests.
* Returns `400 Bad Request` if validation fails.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The API handles errors gracefully and returns meaningful responses:

* `200 OK` – Successful request
* `201 Created` – Resource created successfully
* `400 Bad Request` – Invalid or missing input data
* `404 Not Found` – User not found
* `500 Internal Server Error` – Server-side error

---

## 🗄️ Data Source

* User data is stored **in-memory** using a JavaScript array.
* No external database is used, as per assignment requirements.

---

## 🧪 API Testing

* All endpoints were tested using **Postman / Thunder Client**.
* Screenshots of test results are included separately as required for submission.

---

## 📝 Code Documentation

* Clear and meaningful comments are added throughout the code to explain the logic and flow.
